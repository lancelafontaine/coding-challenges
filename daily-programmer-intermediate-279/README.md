## Daily Programmer (Intermediate #279)

Challenge from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4ybbcz/20160818_challenge_279_intermediate_text_reflow/).

### Description:

Text reflow means to break up lines of text so that they fit within a certain width. It is useful in e.g. mobile browsers. When you zoom in on a web page the lines will become too long to fit the width of the screen, unless the text is broken up into shorter lines.

### Input:

You will be given a text with a maximum line width of 80 characters.

### Output:

Produce the same text with a maximum line width of 40 characters

### Bonus:

Let's get rid of the jagged right margin of the text and make the output prettier. Output the text with full justification; Adjusting the word spacing so that the text is flush against both the left and the right margin.

## Daily Programmer (Easy #41)

Challenge from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/shp28/4192012_challenge_41_easy/).

Write a program that will accept a sentence as input and then output that sentence surrounded by some type of an ASCII decoratoin banner.

Sample run:

Enter a sentence: So long and thanks for all the fish

Output
```
*****************************************
*                                       *
*  So long and thanks for all the fish  *
*                                       *
*****************************************
```

Bonus: If the sentence is too long, move words to the next line.
